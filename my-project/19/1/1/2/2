Based on the detailed timeline and progress you've shared, it seems like you are going through multiple steps, learning, and evolving. Here’s a breakdown of what I understand, and how you can think about your performance:

### Key Timeline:
- **December 19, 2024**: You started tracking your credits and mentioned that if you follow the right order, you would take around 1.5 months to complete the tasks. However, if you follow your original plan, it could take 2-3 months, causing you to face delays due to “freeze duration.”
- **December 30, 2024**: You received your IT Master's certificate, which felt like an accomplishment for you, and you appreciated the educational system in Finland for helping you overcome self-doubt.
- **December 21, 2024**: You experienced a problem with verification due to a missing NetBank ID, which delayed your progress until you were guided about how to continue.
- **December 27 - 30, 2024**: You mentioned working on your GitHub and finishing both front-end and back-end tasks, but did not start the exercises, feeling like you were wasting time and effort during this period.
- **January 1, 2025**: You did some commits, but it seems you’ve yet to start some exercises or key tasks in your project work.

### Assessment of Your Performance:
#### Before:
1. **Challenges**: 
   - Uncertainty due to lack of knowledge about local rules and culture.
   - Family stress, leading to a feeling of isolation.
   - Difficulty starting or continuing tasks (e.g., missing NetBank ID, verification issues).
   - Feeling like efforts weren’t yielding results.
   
2. **Output (before following the right plan)**:
   - Many of your actions felt like wasted effort or unproductive because of these obstacles.
   - Your mental health was a significant barrier to clear performance, impacting your efficiency.

#### After:
1. **Improvements**: 
   - Gained **14 credits**, started understanding more about your path, and got your IT Master's certificate.
   - Overcame the self-doubt, particularly through support and feedback from your teacher.
   - Completed project work, although there were moments when you felt wasted time (like not starting the exercises).
   - Your ability to navigate challenges and continue, despite difficulties, shows growth.
   
2. **Output (after adjustments)**:
   - You began to focus on the right order, reducing stress and improving performance.
   - Your new strategy, using asynchronous methods, could optimize the process.
   - Completion of some major tasks, although there are still some remaining actions like finishing the exam or fixing the details.

### **Efficiency & Performance (Before and After)**:
Let’s consider your **before** and **after** states in terms of time efficiency and output.

- **Before (Wasted Effort/Delayed Progress)**:
   - From **19/12 - 26/12**, you worked a lot but didn’t start the exercises yet. It’s clear that time was spent with little outcome (inefficiency).
   - During this period, the performance could be low due to distractions, lack of clarity, and obstacles.

   *Estimated Performance: 40%*
   - Progress was slower than expected due to the above obstacles.

- **After (With Better Focus and Strategy)**:
   - Following your **right order** and the **asynchronous approach** would likely lead to better results. The fact that you finished the **frontend and backend tasks** is a clear sign of improvement, even if there are still details to finish.
   - You are managing your time more effectively now, focusing on what needs to be done next.

   *Estimated Performance: 70-80%*
   - With consistent effort and some delays handled, you’re on track to complete your tasks with greater efficiency.

### Final Rating and Analysis:
- **Before** (Wasted Time and Effort): **40% Efficiency**  
- **After** (Focused on Plan and Reduced Delay): **70-80% Efficiency**

### Conclusion:
From a **progression** standpoint, you’ve made great strides in terms of handling your tasks, tracking progress, and increasing efficiency. By overcoming some personal barriers and implementing better planning strategies (like asynchronous methods), you're on track to complete your goals, though some obstacles remain.
